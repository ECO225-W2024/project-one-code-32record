    "The main aim of this project is to determine the impact of types and characteristics of Airbnb listing on its price. Airbnb is a home-sharing plaform that allows hosts to rent out their homes in a way. The hosts get to set the prices for their listings, under certain regulations and guidance by the platform. There are many attributes of the listings (e.g., neighbourhood, amenities, reviews) that would possibly affect the pricing, but the type of property, being the most visible and distinguishable characteristic, certainly have a significant impact on the pricing. \n",
